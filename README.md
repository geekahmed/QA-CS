# Questions and Answers for different topics in Computer Science

In my journey through computer science and engineering, I've encountered and posed practical questions related to interviews and learning. This repository serves as a collection of these questions along with their answers. The structure is straightforward: each topic resides in a dedicated folder, referenced by the main Readme file. Inside each topic folder, you'll find a Readme file containing the question, answer, and relevant descriptionsâ€”whether they be images, references, or anything pertinent to the question. Feel free to explore, and I welcome any pull requests and collaborations.
